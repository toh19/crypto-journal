Database Schema Design Steps:

Tables:

1. Users: 
To store user information.
  - user_id: Unique identifier for each user.
  - email: User's email address.
  - password: Hashed password for security.
  - created_at: Date and time when the user registered.
  - updated_at: Date and time of the last update to the user's profile.

2. Cryptocurrencies: 
To store information about each cryptocurrency.
  - crypto_id: Unique identifier for each cryptocurrency.
  - name: Name of the cryptocurrency.
  - symbol: Short symbol representing the cryptocurrency (e.g., BTC for Bitcoin).
  - current_price: Current price of the cryptocurrency.
  - market_cap: Market capitalization.
  - volume: 24-hour trading volume.
  - description: Brief description of the cryptocurrency.
  - logo_url: URL to the cryptocurrency's logo.

3. User_Portfolio: 
To store the cryptocurrencies owned by each user.
  - portfolio_id: Unique identifier for each entry.
  - user_id: Reference to the user who owns the cryptocurrency.
  - crypto_id: Reference to the cryptocurrency.
  - amount: Amount of the cryptocurrency owned by the user.
  - purchase_price: Price at which the user bought the cryptocurrency.
  - purchase_date: Date when the user bought the cryptocurrency.

Relationships:

  - Users and User_Portfolio: One-to-many relationship. One user can have multiple entries in their portfolio, but each portfolio entry belongs to one user.
  - Cryptocurrencies and User_Portfolio: One-to-many relationship. One cryptocurrency can be owned by multiple users, but each portfolio entry refers to one cryptocurrency.

Indexes:

  - Create indexes on frequently queried columns to improve query performance. For example, an index on the email column in the Users table will speed up login operations.

Security:

  - Ensure that sensitive data, like passwords, are hashed before storing in the database.
  - Implement proper access controls to prevent unauthorized access to user data.
