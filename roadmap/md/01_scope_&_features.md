## Prioritization:
Now that we have a preliminary list of features, it's essential to prioritize them. Depending on your timeline and resources, you might want to start with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that includes the core features and then expand based on user feedback.

## Next Steps:
- Decide which features are essential for the MVP.
- Sketch the UI: Create wireframes or mockups of the user interface.
- Database Design: Decide on the database schema, tables, and relationships.
